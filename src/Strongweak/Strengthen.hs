{- | Attempt to strengthen some @'Weakened' a@, asserting certain invariants.

We take 'Weaken' as a superclass in order to maintain strong/weak type pair
consistency. We choose this dependency direction because we treat the strong
type as the "canonical" one, so 'Weaken' is the more natural (and
straightforward) class to define. That does mean the instances for this class
are a little confusingly worded. Alas.

See "Strongweak" for class design notes and laws.
