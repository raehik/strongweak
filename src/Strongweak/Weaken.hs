{- | A "via type" newtype for defining strongweak instances for zero-invariant,

Use like so:

@
deriving 'Weaken' via 'SWCoercibly' a
@

Or standalone:

@
via 'SWCoercibly' a instance 'Weaken' ('Identity' a)
@

Note that usage of this incurs UndecidableInstances. That's life. You can
write the trivial instances this generates yourself if you so wish.
